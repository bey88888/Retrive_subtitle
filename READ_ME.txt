-File name 'a' contain code to insert data into database
-use file 'b' to input time value in order to get corresponding subtitle
-use file 'b-1' to input subtitle value in order to get corresponding time

Note: As their is a problem in detecting the blank line(var_dump is showing some length)
      This code will only work for those srt file which consist of only one or two lines.
      This code is not done by considering each subtitle as object.
